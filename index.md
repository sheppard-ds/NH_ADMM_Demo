# NH Assets Introduction

This is an intial demo of how the ADMM of National Highways could be displayed using GitHub Pages with example templates showing Assets entries; including a description, their sub-class, asset and componenets (where applicable).

## 

This is version 0.1, created 22 December 2022

## NH Data Assets 

The following is taken from the [Standards for Highways Website](https://standardsforhighways.co.uk/ha/standards/admm/index.htm)

For each asset entry there is:

- Asset Class Hierarchy – an overview of the asset class hierarchy. This takes on of the following forms:
    - Asset Class – Asset Subclass – Asset
    - Asset-Component Relationship

For each asset entry (excluding Drainage, Roadside Operational Technology and Structures asset classes):

- Description – a textual description detailing the asset, matching the description found in the Data Dictionary.

- An example image – a generic example image demonstrating the asset (this may be further highlighted to specify the asset in context).

- Asset Code – the four-digit code, referencing the asset within the Data Dictionary.

- Asset Class/Subclass –the class and subclass the asset belongs to, indicative of its relationship to a group of other assets as set out in the Data Dictionary, and the relevant procedures, rules, and personnel.

- Asset Geometry – i.e. Point, Line, or Polygon: this corresponds to the geospatial reference data for the asset and gives an idea of the space it occupies in the real world.
    - Assets that occupy a single location are considered Point (e.g. Sign Face, Reference Marker Locations, Bollards, etc.)
